This architecture serves as a framework for developing Angular projects efficiently, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and scalability. It consists of three main directories:

#### Core:
The "core" directory contains essential components that form the foundation of the application. This includes base classes, models, services, interceptors, and utilities. These elements are eagerly loaded and are fundamental to the structure of the application.

#### Pages:
In the "pages" directory, each page of the application or each distinct entity is organized into separate modules. These modules are lazily loaded, ensuring optimal performance by only loading the necessary components when they are required. Each page module encapsulates the components, services, and other assets specific to that page, promoting modularity and encapsulation.

#### Shared:
The "shared" directory houses components, modules, services, and other assets that are shared across multiple pages of the application. These reusable elements help avoid code duplication and promote consistency throughout the application. Components and services stored in the "shared" directory can be easily accessed and utilized within individual page modules, enhancing productivity and maintainability.

Benefits of the Architecture:

Promotes code reusability and maintainability through modularization and encapsulation.
Supports lazy loading for optimal performance by loading components on demand.
Facilitates collaboration and consistency by providing a centralized location for shared components and services.
Enhances scalability by organizing the project into distinct modules, making it easier to add new features or expand existing functionality.
Example Usage:
In a specific page module, such as the "dashboard" module, components and services from the shared directory, such as a "header" component or an "authentication" service, can be seamlessly imported and utilized. This exemplifies how the architecture encourages code reuse and simplifies development tasks.

Conclusion:
By adopting this architecture for Angular projects, developers can streamline development processes, reduce code complexity, and build robust and scalable applications that meet the needs of modern web development.
